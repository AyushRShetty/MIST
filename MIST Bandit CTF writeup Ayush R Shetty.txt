First we accesed the given host address using ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
where 2220 is the port number . ssh comand is used to connect to a server

Then I entered the password given in the website bandit0.

Then I used the ls command to make the server show me all the files stored in the server . There was one called readme

I opened the file using cat command which shows the content of the readme me file . Command used : cat readme

It displyed the following password : NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL

I then exited out of the bandit0 server and logged into the bandit1 server using ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

I entered the password that I had found above .

The website details told me that the file was on - located in the home directory
I tried using home/- to access it but showed that no such directory exists . So i thought maybe the current directory was the home directory . So i directly tried to use cat - but that too didn't work . Finally I was able to access it by using  ./- command . ./ helped me access the file in the folder and I got another password rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi

Aceesed the third address ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 using the above password . The  file was in the home directory and was called spaces in the filename . 
I tried $ cat ./spaces in this filename .
However it showed the follwoing error 
cat: ./spaces: No such file or directory
cat: in: No such file or directory
cat: this: No such file or directory
cat: filename: No such file or directory
 So then I used it with "" and this was the result :

 cat ./"spaces in this filename"
aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG

Used to above password to access bandit3

ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
The website says that file is located in inhere directory so I changed to directory from home (.) to inhere

Then I checked for files using ls but it didnt work . Lokked around for a while and found out that we had to use ls -a to List all hidden dot files .
used the same and found ~/inhere$ ls -a
.  ..  .hidden
 accessed .hidden using cat .hidden for  the password 2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe

Accesed bandit 4 using the password 
ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

Problem : The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

first used cd to change to inhere directory
Then used ls to checked all the files in the directory .
Found 10 files
$ ls
-file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08
-file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09

used $ file ./-file00 to check first file type but it showed data

Then used the file ./* command to check file type of each file together way faster . Founnd that 
file ./*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: Non-ISO extended-ASCII text, with NEL line terminators
./-file06: Non-ISO extended-ASCII text, with no line terminators, with escape sequences
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data

checked file 5 and 6 but they showed garbage values $ cat ./-file05
5 ?: o ҫ\ԑ2s  =n̩- `C9  `V _ 

Checked 7 which had ASCII text to find password
lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR


logged into $ ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 using password 
Problem : The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

used cd inhere to go to inhere directory

used ls to find files but it showed 20 more directories

$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16
maybehere01  maybehere05  maybehere09  maybehere13  maybehere17
maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18
maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19

used find function with specs given in question to search for the specific file 

find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable

-type f so that it only searches for files and nothing else like directories . -size 1033c to specify size . c refer to bytes
! -executable so that no executable file is retured as mentioned in question . 
./maybehere07/.file2 returned

cd maybehere07 to change dirextory
cat .file2 to access file

Aceesed ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
 The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

What i tried before looking for soln 

$ cd bandit7
-bash: cd: bandit7: No such file or directory
bandit6@bandit:~$ find -type f size 33c
find: paths must precede expression: `size'
bandit6@bandit:~$ ls
bandit6@bandit:~$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile
bandit6@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 0

used find command according to file specs $ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c

Search for user bandit7 , group bandit6 and file size 33 bytes .

looked through the library and found almost all denied access other than /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

used $ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Later found better way to do this 
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>&1 | grep -F -v Permission | grep -F -v directory filters directories without access permissions and hence can easily access key file

problem : The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

used ls to see files . found data.txt .

used cat data.txt . The whole screen got filled with a gazillion words... saw the problem agaain and found that I had to use the key next to  the word millionth . 

used cat data.txt|grep millionth

found pass TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP

grep is used to find certain patterns in a file or file directory . Here I used grep to find the word millionth in the data.txt file

Accesed ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 using pass

problem :The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

used ls to find file . found data.txt 

Problem asks us to find line that occurs only ones. So i used
cat data.txt|uniq -u
 However this printed all the lines which are unique and it was too many . I later found out that -u only removes adjacent duplicate lines and hence the list had to be sorted first

so I used $ cat data.txt|sort EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t

Then I used cat data.txt|uniq -u but it showed me all the lines which were multiple  in single format . Hence I found out that I had to specify that I wanted a file that occured once . So I used

$ cat data.txt|sort|uniq -c -u
sorting seperatly and finding uniq was giving me problems so I used  them simulataneously
-c gives count of number pf times a line had been repeated .
-u removes duplicate lines (only adjacent lines)
